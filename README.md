# Sistema Bancario

This project is a **basic banking system simulation in Java**, designed to model the main entities of a bank and their interactions.

## 📌 Description
The system includes the following classes:
- **Banco** (Bank)  
- **Atm** (ATM)  
- **Cliente** (Client)  
- **Cuenta** (Bank Account)  

The file **PruebasBanco.java** creates instances of these objects, assigns accounts to clients, links ATMs to banks, and prints information to the console.  
👉 The goal is to test the creation and management of banking entities in a simple way.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.  
2. Navigate to the file `PruebasBanco.java`.  
3. Run the file → the console will display clients, accounts, banks, and ATM information.

## 📚 Learning Purpose
This project was developed to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, with emphasis on:
- Class design and object relationships  
- Object creation and interaction  
- Simulating real-world entities through code
